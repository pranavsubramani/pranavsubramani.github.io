I'm currently an Undergraduate who is interested in quite a few areas of optimization, computer science, statistics and a few other areas. The general purpose of this blog is to talk about some areas that I'm interested in, with the hopes that it will stir interest into these areas, and as a learning experience in both writing and explaining some fairly interesting ideas.
