synopsis: "The reason I am starting this blog"
---

I'm currently an Undergraduate who is interested in quite a few areas of optimization, computer science, statistics and a few other areas. The general purpose of this blog is to talk about some areas that I'm interested in, with the hopes that it will stir interest into these areas, and as a learning experience in both writing and explaining some fairly interesting ideas.

EDIT: 2019 - After around 2 years, I've finally started finding more time on average to begin writing a series of exploratory blog posts about a variety of different subjects. I've been working on probabilistic graphical models Some of them that I'll try to cover in the blog will be:

1. Probabilistic Inference and Probabilistic Machine Learning

2. Computational Linear Algebra

3. Semidefinite Optimization

4. Probabilistic Graphical Models (classical)

And a bunch of other areas! If you find anything to be questionable or interesting, feel free to reach out to me and ask me questions about the blog posts.
